            We created this website while actively communicating with one-another and sharing ideas, using each other's 
            advice to guide our decisions and improve the design of our site. Throughout the process, we collaborated closely, 
            discussed challenges, and combined our individual strengths to build a website that reflects our teamwork and collective effort.
